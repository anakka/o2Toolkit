	<h2>About Toolkit</h2>

	<p>A front-end toolkit acts as a reference, not only for developers but for anyone working on the front-end of a website. It is a “living” body of front-end code and specifications for a website which is updated as and when a site develops during its lifetime.</p><p> This "living" body of code is built from the same code used to build the website and in this way helps to ensure that there is always up-to-date documentation for the front-end interface. </p>

	<h3>Why do we need them?</h3>

	<p>The aim of a front-end toolkit is to help prevent duplication of code and to encourage collaboration between design and development teams. Websites are constantly changing entities in terms of content, 'look and feel' and code.</p><p> Designers and developers who work on websites also change continuously. Without fully documenting the front-end of a website, it can be difficult for designers or developers new to a project to understand what components are already available on the site, what components can be re-used and which components need to be built.</p>
